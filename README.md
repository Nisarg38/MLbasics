# MLbasics
Compilation of Projects using basic ML Algorithms. For this basic understanding project, I am using pycharm and Tenserflow with other required libraries. 

## 1. Linear Regression 

A simple use case of predicting the possibility with a linear regression algorithm. 

For this project I took a dataset of students performing with multiple attributes and selected 5 attributes which I find will help give the best result, the algorithm basically predicts the Final Grade of the student based on the previous marks, attendance, etc.
